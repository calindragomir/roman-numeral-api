# Roman Numerals

Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers are written with combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet, each letter with a fixed integer value.

Roman numerals use different symbols for each power of ten and there is no zero symbol, in contrast with the place value notation of Arabic numerals (in which place-keeping zeros enable the same digit to represent different powers of ten).

The following table displays how Roman numerals are usually written:

|   | Thousands  | Hundreds | Tens | Units |
|:-:|:----------:|:--------:|:----:|:-----:|
| 1 |     M      |    C     |  X   |   I   |
| 2 |     MM     |    CC    |  XX  |  II   |
| 3 |    MMM     |   CCC    | XXX  |  III  |
| 4 |            |    CD    |  XL  |  IV   |
| 5 |            |    D     |  L   |   V   |
| 6 |            |    DC    |  LX  |  VI   |
| 7 |            |   DCC    | LXX  |  VII  |
| 8 |            |   DCCC   | LXXX | VIII  |
| 9 |            |    CM    |  XC  |  IX   |
